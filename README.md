# 📱 ASTRA App – Citizen Engagement Platform

ASTRA App is the citizen’s lifeline in the ASTRA ecosystem.  
It transforms NASA’s open data APIs into real‑time alerts, missions, and AR blueprints that empower communities to detect threats, validate data, and co‑design resilient cities.  

🌍 From space to street, the ASTRA App puts NASA’s satellites in every citizen’s pocket.

# 🏙 Civic Blueprint – AR Urban Planning
- Citizens preview interventions in their own neighborhoods.  
- AR overlays show green roofs, cooling corridors, drainage systems.  
- Proposals can be submitted directly to planners.

# 📜 Legacy Track – History & Accountability
- Timeline of past interventions.  
- NASA APIs confirm measurable impact: cooler streets, greener cover, safer floods.  
- Transparent accountability: “You Said → We Did.”
